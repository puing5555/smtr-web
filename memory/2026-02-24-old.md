## SMTR Modal UI 개선 완료
- Sub-agent `modal-fix` crashed (context limit) — only added `videoSummary?: string` to interface
- I picked up remaining work manually:
  - Removed: 영상 제목 section, 분석 요약 (green box), 메타데이터 grid (신뢰도/시간프레임/조건부/실전투자), duplicate YouTube button
  - Added: 영상요약 보기/접기 toggle, 차트보기 + 영상보기 buttons side by side
  - Added `showSummary` state, reset on modal open
- Sub-agent corrupted `corinpapa-signals.ts` encoding via PowerShell `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8` → restored from git
- Build succeeded, deployed to smtr-web, pushed commit `f116936`
- Verified: JS chunk `981783d3ac190884.js` contains 차트보기/영상요약, no 분석 요약

## Pending
- **videoSummary data mapping**: Interface has field but no signal has data yet → toggle won't show
- Korean video titles (English→Korean)
- Korean YouTube links
- 차트보기 button currently links to guru_tracker_v24.html (not stock-specific yet)
- Additional influencers pipeline
- Telegram bot recovery

## Lessons
- PowerShell `$_.FullName` doesn't work in pipeline with `Get-Content` — use `node -e` for file searching
- PowerShell `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8` adds BOM and can corrupt Korean text — use `edit` tool instead
- Sub-agents can crash on context limit; always verify their work
