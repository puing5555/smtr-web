## XRP Chart Fix for invest-sns

Jay Jay (Telegram group 인플루언서주식ai) reported XRP chart broken on smtr-web.

### Root causes found & fixed:
1. **XRP missing from `generateStaticParams`** — added `{ symbol: 'XRP' }` to stocks/[symbol]/page.tsx
2. **6 missing stub pages** — stocks index, premium, profile, alerts, signals, bots had no page.tsx, causing client-side crashes. Created placeholder pages.
3. **RSC payload path mismatch** — added `trailingSlash: true` to next.config.ts
4. **lightweight-charts SSR crash** — library needs `window`/`document`, fails during hydration. Changed StockChartClient.tsx to use dynamic `await import('lightweight-charts')` with type-only static imports.

### Deploy process:
- Source: `invest-sns` → `npm run build` → `out/`
- Deploy: delete old `_next` in smtr-web, copy `out/*`, git push
- URL: puing5555.github.io/smtr-web

### Status: Rebuild needed after lightweight-charts fix, then redeploy.
